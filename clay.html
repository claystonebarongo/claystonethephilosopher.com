            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>In the intricate tapestry of my life, I am Claystone Barongo—a spoken word artist whose journey intertwines with the vibrant threads of literature, family, and relentless self-expression. Born amidst Kisii County's lush landscapes in 2004, alongside my twin brother, Stoneclay, the allure of the written word captivated me from early on, kindling a passion for poetry and prose that shaped my very existence.

                In the embrace of solitude, I sought solace within the pages of novels, finding guidance in the works of literary giants like Chinua Achebe and Ken Walibora. Yet, my journey was not solitary; it was nurtured by the sturdy roots of family and community. My parents, Elijah Mbweke, a respected figure in local politics, and Doris Rabera, whose love and strength sustained me, laid the foundation for my aspirations.
                
                Though grief shadowed my path with the loss of my mother, her memory became a beacon of purpose. Fuelled by ambition and the legacy of my forebears, I embarked on a quest to leave my mark on the world.
                
                In the mosaic of my interests, the allure of leadership and governance beckoned, influenced by political stalwarts like James Orengo and Raila Odinga. Initially drawn towards medicine or law, recognizing their potential for impact, I was inspired by figures such as PLO Lumumba and Ben Carson. However, it was software engineering that ultimately ignited my passion—a field where creativity meets innovation, echoing the rhythmic cadence of spoken word poetry.
                
                Alongside my siblings—Barrack, Brian Ayienda, Austine Mogonchi, Francis M. Bweke, Verah Nyatuka, and Violet Moraa—I embarked on a journey of self-discovery and collective growth, bound by the ties of blood and kinship.
                
                As I stand poised at the threshold of tomorrow, I am grateful for the winding path that has led me here. Each twist and turn, every triumph and tribulation, has shaped me into the person I am—a poet, a dreamer, a seeker of truth. And while my journey may have taken unexpected turns, I embrace the path I've chosen—a tapestry woven from the threads of love, loss, and the resilience of the human spirit, guided by a purpose greater than I could have imagined.</p>

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>Embarking on my educational journey in 2008 at Hezina Primary School, I took my first steps into the world of learning. However, it was at Malacare Memorial School where I undertook my KCPE exams in 2018, leaving an indelible mark with a stellar performance, clinching an A grade with an impressive 375 marks. This achievement showcased my dedication and thirst for knowledge right from the outset.

                Transitioning to secondary education at St. Edward Nyabioto High School, I continued to carve my path, consistently ranking at the top of my class. Yet, amidst the academic rigors, I found myself drawn to the captivating world of software engineering, a passion instilled by my brother Barack, to whom I owe a debt of gratitude that transcends words.
                
                My journey of leadership commenced during my formative years at Malacare Memorial School and later at St. Edward Nyabioto, where I had the honor of serving as the school president. These leadership roles not only nurtured my sense of responsibility but also fostered a deep-seated commitment to making a positive impact within my school community.
                
                Now, as I navigate the halls of Kirinyaga University, pursuing a degree in software engineering, I remain deeply engaged in campus politics. My tenure as a student leader persists, as I channel my energy into advocating for student welfare and championing initiatives that foster a vibrant academic environment.
                
                Each step of my educational journey, from Hezina Primary School to Malacare Memorial School, from St. Edward Nyabioto High School to Kirinyaga University, has been characterized by a relentless pursuit of excellence, fueled by a passion for learning and a commitment to leadership and service.</p>
